Hello All,

This is the Intention Repeater program. It takes your intention, and repeats it thousands or even over a million times per second
in computer memory. When you repeat things, it programs the Quantum Field to affect change. Computers are no different.

I placed this into open source in order that it might be developed and improved upon.

The Intensity determines how many 0's are in the number of iterations per second, minus one.
So Intensity of 1 would be one iteration per second. Intensity of 7 would be 1 million iterations per second,
depending on the hardware. If your hardware can't do 10 million iterations per second, then
Intensity of 8 would be full power after one million iterations per second.

Start with an Intensity of 4 or 5 and give it 15 mins at least. Or stop if it gets too much.

Sample intentions are:

My heart is filled with Love.

I am calm and confident.

My dogs are healed.

My chakras are balanced.

I am filled with orgasmic bliss.

The Australian bushfires have just enough euphoric rains to put them out.

Feel free to play around with this software, and add to the project if you are able.

There are no guarantees. Though this program produces a strong energy field, and can produce profound bliss.

Thank You.

Run using python3.
